It's going to be a little project in html that contains some recipes indexed in a main directory. First, i'm going to make this with just HTML, but later i'll use CSS to make it more stylish!

OBS: I've used (copied) information from other recipes sites, IT IS NOT original content. It was my first project, so i took some freedom to do this.
